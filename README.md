# 🧠 CommitGenius

> Create meaningful, hilarious, poetic, or professional git commits... from your diffs.

**CommitGenius** is a local LLM-powered CLI tool that turns your staged git diffs into beautiful commit messages in seconds.

🚀 Powered by [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) running **LLaMA 3**, works fully offline.  
💬 Supports tones like `funny`, `pro`, `casual`, even `poetic`.  
🔪 Truncates huge diffs automatically to avoid melting your CPU.

## 📦 Installation

### 1. Install [Ollama](https://ollama.com/)
> Works on macOS, Windows, Linux. No GPU required (but it's faster with one).

```bash
# Download and install Ollama
https://ollama.com/download
```

### 2. Pull the model
We recommend [llama3:8b] for best balance of speed and quality:

```bash
ollama run llama3:8b
```

You only need to run this once — it will download and cache the model.

### 3. Install CommitGenius

```bash
npm install -g commitgenius
```

Or for local dev:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/commitgenius
cd commitgenius
npm install
npm link
```

## 🧪 Usage

💻 Generate a commit message from staged changes:

```bash
git add .
commitgen --tone pro
```

It will:
- Read your git diff

- Suggest a commit message
- Ask you if you want to use it

## 🎭 Tone Options

| Tone    | Description                        |
|---------|------------------------------------|
| pro     | Clean, concise, professional       |
| funny   | Sarcastic or witty                 |
| casual  | Like you're texting your teammate  |
| poetic  | Shakespeare meets GitHub           |

```bash
commitgen --tone funny
```

---


## ✂️ Large Diff Support

By default, we:
- Truncate diffs to ~6000 characters (safe for most models)
- Remove blank lines and comments
- Only keep meaningful context

Use `--full` to disable truncation (⚠️ may break on weaker machines):

```bash
commitgen --full --tone casual
```
